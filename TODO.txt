TODO

- Update and lightly comment the rest of the default patterns, especially the PI Sound patterns
  - block reflections (done, explores remainder / modulus)
  - color bands (done, good example of intermittent white)
  - color fade pulse (done)
  - color twinkle bounce (done)
  - color twinkles (done)
  - fast pulse (done)
  - firework dust (done. explains random())
  - gitch bands (done. So cool.)
  - green ripple reflections (done)
  - marching rainbow (done)
  - mllipede (done)
  - opposites (done)
  - ranbow melt
  - slow color shift
  - sound - blinkfade
  - sound - rays (fun)
  - sound spectro kalidastrip
  - sound - spectromatix ptim (is there a new one in the lib?)
  - sparks center
  - sparks (deserves a nice explinaion)
  - spin cycle

- (Ben could do this too) - Select some community patterns for inclusion, including zranger and ChrisNZ
  - One of the flame effect ones from the library
  - Roger Chang's 2D/3D mapper test patterns
  - Your PRNG in static random colors
  - xorcery
  - lightning + link to your youtube/insta of that install
  - Some of the 3D patterns
    - 3D Rotation / Spotlights
    - cube fire 3D
    - fast pulse 3d
  - my scrolling text marquee
  - Scott Balay's pew pew pew
  - edgeburst and fireflies are highly upvoted (I now understand how that's not a totally pure signal, but I like them too for variety)
  - Some of zranger and ChrisNZ's recent work (possibly midpoint displacement or the basic spectrum analyzer)


DONE / NOTES

- Add patterns in the check batch emailed to Ben 7/13/20 (done)

- Add the rewritten patterns for 2D code emailed earlier
  - matrix 2D pulse (done)
  - matrix 2D honeycomb (done)

- Make the edits suggested in Ben's 7/19/20 feedback on the initial batch
  - blink fade array note (done)

  - modes and waveforms: "I think that using an hsv picker for hue and a slider for saturation is kind of a UX weirdness. Demoing controls might be better done elsewhere, but I can see some value in merging an hsv picker with the demo textures." (done - will remove UI control demo when a separate, more intentional "Example: UI controls" is created)

  - An intro: "Keyboard shortcuts url
      https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts" (done)

  - firework rocket sparks (done)

- Check and remove 2nd version of rainbow fonts (done. Picked the version I 
thought was clearer. Previous versions had v set to 0.2, which quite muted the
preview image. If this was intentional because its intensity dominates the
pattern list, please but it back in.)
