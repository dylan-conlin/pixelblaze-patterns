TODO

- Adapt community patterns for inclusion:
  - Roger Chang
    - Accelerometer test pattern

- Move media to Ben's youtube account if time/energy
  - Might be moot bacause possibly 2D previews on-board

- Add new patterns not yet written
  - Transform 0..1 hue into 2 color pallette
    - https://forum.electromage.com/t/pattern-request-two-moving-colors/414
  - "A collection of useful techinques"


DONE / NOTES

- Add patterns in the check batch emailed to Ben 7/13/20

- Add the rewritten patterns for 2D code emailed earlier
  - matrix 2D pulse
  - matrix 2D honeycomb

- Make the edits suggested in Ben's 7/19/20 feedback on the initial batch
  - blink fade array note
  - modes and waveforms: "I think that using an hsv picker for hue and a slider for saturation is kind of a UX weirdness. Demoing controls might be better done elsewhere, but I can see some value in merging an hsv picker with the demo textures."
    - Removed UI control demo in Examples
    - ToDo: Create a separate, intentional "Example: UI controls"
  - An intro: "Keyboard shortcuts url for ACE
      https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts"
  - firework rocket sparks is less of a learning odyssey

- Check and remove 2nd version of rainbow fonts.
  - Picked the version I thought was clearer. Previous versions had v set to 0.2, which muted the preview image. If this was intentional because its intensity dominates the pattern list, please put it back in.

- Update and lightly comment the rest of the default patterns
  - block reflections (explores remainder / modulus)
  - color bands (good example of intermittent white)
  - color fade pulse
  - color twinkle bounce
  - color twinkles
  - fast pulse
  - firework dust (explains random())
  - gitch bands
  - green ripple reflections
  - marching rainbow
  - mllipede
  - opposites
  - ranbow font
  - ranbow melt
  - slow color shift
  - sound - blinkfade (sound simulator)
  - sound - rays (simpler sound sim)
  - sound spectro kalidastrip (frequencyData sim)
  - sound - spectromatix optim
  - sparks center
  - sparks
  - spin cycle (nominate as replaceable if too many patterns)

- Added a Python script to generate the sourcecode in src/ from epe/.

  The .pb files in src/ are just for convenient editing and viewing in text
  editors and GitHub. The .epe files also contain the source code, so there was
  the change for disagreement as to which was the authoritative version. With
  this change, it's assumed that epe/ and bin/ are authoritative, and src/ is a
  derived convenience.

- Adapted community patterns for inclusion
  - Roger Cheng
    - permission secured via email, and Roger noted it's already MIT:

    - 2D/3D mapper test patterns adapted into "Utility: Mapping helper 2D/3D"

  - 3D patterns
    - cube fire 3D (Wizard)
      - linked video +
    - fast pulse 3d (Wizard)
      - linked video +
    - 3D Rotation / Spotlights
      - linked video + 

  - Scott Balay's pew pew pew
    - permission secured / MIT
    - use sound reactive one

  - Jvyduna Scrolling text marquee with fix from forum

  - lightning ZAP!
    - Includes a color picker

  - Automate binary bytecode export / "minting imager" within Firestorm

  - static random colors (deterministic PRNG) - Faded pixels in and out for a more lively presentation with music in the default sequencer.

  - edgeburst

  - sparkfire (Some adaptations for strip length)

    - spiral twirls 2D + 1D/3D + YouTube output demo
      - Fatal bug: atan(0,0) will reboot board; can get stuck
      - Safety shim added
    - sound - spectrum analyzer 1D/2D

  - Xorcery 2D / 3D + YouTube output demo
    - Note, this is now very similar to "block reflections" in 1D - that one could be eliminated to lighten the list (though it has more verbose comments that should then be moved into Xorcery)

  - Fireflies

  - UI sliders now represented: Speed in lightning ZAP (renamed "Example:")

- "matrix 2D honeycomb" renamed "honeycomb 2D/3D" and given 1D & 3D renderers + Youtube demo

- "matrix 2D pulse" renamed "pulse 2D" and given 1D renderer + Youtube demo

- Re-recorded Youtube 1D/2D/3D "preview" for "sound - spectrum analyser 1D/2D"

- zranger1 (Jon)
  - permission secured / MIT
  - color temperature
  - midpoint displacement noise
  - multisegment

- Spell checked all patterns. Whoa I'm bad.
