TODO

- Adapt community patterns for inclusion:

  Currently in the repo, not yet normalized
    - Ben's
      - xorcery 2D / 3D
        - record Youtube preview
    - zranger Jon 
      - permission secured / MIT
      - Midpoint displacement
      - Multisegment
      - Color temperature

  Not yet in repo
    - Roger Chang
      - Accelerometer test pattern
    - ChrisNZ
      - Permission secired
      - basic matrix spectrum analyzer
      - 2D Spiral Twirls
    - Unknown author: Fireflies


- Are UI sliders represented? Quick: add to lightning ZAP for speed.

- Re-record Youtube 2D "previews" on 16x16 SK9822

- Move media to Ben's youtube account if time/energy




DONE / NOTES

- Add patterns in the check batch emailed to Ben 7/13/20


- Add the rewritten patterns for 2D code emailed earlier
  - matrix 2D pulse
  - matrix 2D honeycomb


- Make the edits suggested in Ben's 7/19/20 feedback on the initial batch
  - blink fade array note

  - modes and waveforms: "I think that using an hsv picker for hue and a slider for saturation is kind of a UX weirdness. Demoing controls might be better done elsewhere, but I can see some value in merging an hsv picker with the demo textures."
    - Removed UI control demo in Examples
    - ToDo: Create a separate, intentional "Example: UI controls"

  - An intro: "Keyboard shortcuts url for ACE
      https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/wiki/Default-Keyboard-Shortcuts"

  - firework rocket sparks is less of a learning odyssey


- Check and remove 2nd version of rainbow fonts.
  - Picked the version I thought was clearer. Previous versions had v set to 0.2, which muted the preview image. If this was intentional because its intensity dominates the pattern list, please put it back in.


- Update and lightly comment the rest of the default patterns
  - block reflections (explores remainder / modulus)
  - color bands (good example of intermittent white)
  - color fade pulse
  - color twinkle bounce
  - color twinkles
  - fast pulse
  - firework dust (explains random())
  - gitch bands
  - green ripple reflections
  - marching rainbow
  - mllipede
  - opposites
  - ranbow font
  - ranbow melt
  - slow color shift
  - sound - blinkfade (sound simulator)
  - sound - rays (simpler sound sim)
  - sound spectro kalidastrip (frequencyData sim)
  - sound - spectromatix optim
  - sparks center
  - sparks
  - spin cycle (nominate as replaceable if too many patterns)

- Added a Python script to generate the sourcecode in src/ from epe/.

  The .pb files in src/ are just for convenient editing and viewing in text
  editors and GitHub. The .epe files also contain the source code, so there was
  the change for disagreement as to which was the authoritative version. With
  this change, it's assumed that epe/ and bin/ are authoritative, and src/ is a
  derived convenience.
