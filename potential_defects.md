# Potential Defects

1. Can't repro now, but try - after a reflashed 3.4 board, try to upload the copy of "Matrix 2D Pulse.epe" send to Ben on the forum message board. 

    Matrix tab never had "save" pushed

    Either uploading epe or copy-pasting code into editor seemed to hang the board (no  LED ouptput and no preview generated in browser, so save can't be pushed).
    
    Can't repro ever since saving a valid map then clearing the map textfield and saving again.

2. Upon editing a patern (via copy-paste from text files, if that matters), I was able to get the Fast pulse pattenr to somehow generate an invalid preview that would hanf the main pattern page upon loading that preview image. Video: https://youtu.be/O9wP7jfQyCE
