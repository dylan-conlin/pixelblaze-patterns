A 8x8 matrix in a perfect grid, wired the common zigzag way\n  2. Individual pixels on a strand mounted in a triangle hexagon grid\n  3. Equal length strips wired as vertical columns on separate channels\n  of the output expander board\n  \n  To get started quickly with matrices, there's an inexpensive 8x8 on the \n  Pixelblaze store. Load the default Matrix example in the mapper and you're\n  ready to go. \n\n  This pattern builds on the example \"pulse 2D\".
